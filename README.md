# COVID-19 Data Exploration using SQL

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data using SQL. Various SQL techniques such as joins, CTEs, temporary tables, window functions, aggregate functions, and creating views are utilized to explore different aspects of the data.

## Overview of SQL Queries:

### 1. Total Cases and Total Deaths Analysis:
- Analyzes total cases, total deaths, and calculates death rates for specific locations like Spain and Portugal.

### 2. Infection Rate Analysis:
- Examines total cases versus population to determine the percentage of the population infected with COVID-19 in specific countries.

### 3. Highest Infection Rate and Death Count Analysis:
- Identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population and highest death counts per population.

### 4. Continent-Wise Analysis:
- Breaks down data by continent to analyze death counts and identify continents with the highest death counts.

### 5. Global COVID-19 Numbers:
- Presents global statistics including total cases, total deaths, and death percentages.

### 6. Vaccination Analysis:
- Analyzes the relationship between total population and vaccination data for Spain, including calculating the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.

### 7. Intermediate Results Handling:
- Uses CTEs and temporary tables to perform calculations and store intermediate results.

### 8. Creating Views:
- Creates a view to store data for later visualizations.
